# MinimalList
Cosmetic filter lists that eliminate content algorithms, recommendations, dark-patterns, short-form content, and other random junk you don't need nor want on the Internet.

Only works within a browser (e.g.: firefox, brave, etc.).

The project is still in testing stage, and only the YouTube list is now available. Expect frequent breakages (and updates)!

## YouTube List
It Blocks:
- Recommendations on the homepage and next to videos
- YT Shorts (based on https://github.com/gijsdev/ublock-hide-yt-shorts)

It doesn't block:
- Search
- Comments
- Autoplay (based on js)
- Subscriptions
- Account login
